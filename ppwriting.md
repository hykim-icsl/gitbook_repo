## Abstract

We first consider (Conventional system)  
We then propose (Proposed system or Algorithm)  

Describe advantages of Proposed scheme  
ex) The proposed schemes attemp to (increase ... by ...)  

We evaluate the performance of (...) and compare (...) with that of (the conventional scheme)  

In this letter, ( ) system is investigated in ( ) network.  
considering ..., we derive an exact closed form of ...  
Also, ...  
The simulation results verify our analytical results.

## Introduction

The rest of this letter is organized as follows.  
In Section II,
the structure of the problem and proposed solutions are elaborated. Numerical results that support the effectiveness of
the proposed solutions are presented in Section III.  
Finally, Section IV concludes the letter.


Finally, a good agreement of the theoretical results with Monte Carlo simulations verifies the correctness of our analysis
